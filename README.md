# Methylmapper

Methylmapper is a program to produce and display methylation maps from FASTA files.

## Requirements

This program requires the `gdcreate` program from the [gdprogs](https://github.com/albertoriva/gdprogs) repository.
Please ensure that `gdcreate` is in PATH, otherwise use the GDCREATE variable in `bin/methylmapper` to specify
its location.
